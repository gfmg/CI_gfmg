## :sunglasses: Purpose
The objectives of this repository could be summarized:  

1. **Learn the command line interface environment (bash, cmd; including creation, manipulation and how to move data).** 

2. **Compare commonly available software infrastructures and architectures.**

4. **Automate processes (e.g. downloading data) using github workflows.**

## :file_folder: Structure
The repository is structured as follows: 

- `weather.ipynb`: this jupyter notebooks contains a description of each of the weekly tasks requested as part of the course. It also includes a brief analysis of the weather data downloaded for the Athenry station. Additionally, some important notes are included about the development of the project, which objective was the automatization of the download of the weather data using GitHub Workflows 

- `weather.sh`: this bash script downloads daily weather data from the Athenry station from the Met Eirean website.  

- `data`: folder that contains all the weather data downloaded (as well as some previous output files produces as part of the weekly Tasks). 

- `img`: folder to store any images used in the README.md or Jupyter files 

- `.github/workflows`: this folder contains the ```.yml``` files to automate the download of the daily weather data from the Athenry station (```weather-data.yml```) and to update the jupyter notebook (```jupyter-update.yml```) using github actions. 

## :rocket: Installation and use
You can run and modify the content of this repository in two ways: 

1. **Locally in your machine**: simply clone the repository from github by copying the url of the repository as: 

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/gfmg/CI_gfmg.git
        cd your-directory
        ``` 
    The way the repository and code is organized will automatically download and update the jupyter notebook daily in the repository. Remember, that in order for you to locally update the downloaded data and notebook you need to `git pull`. **Also important**, you need to have installed `VS Code` (or any other text editor) and `Python` to run the Jupyter notebook. You may also need to install the Python packages outlined in the `requirements.txt` file: 

        ```bash  
        python -m pip install package
        pip3.13 install package # Alternative based on your currently installed Python version 
        # See here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2812520/dealing-with-multiple-python-versions-and-pip
        ```  

    If you do not have `Git`, `VScode` or `Python` installed here are some useful links: 
      - **Git**: https://git-scm.com/downloads
      - **VS Code**: https://code.visualstudio.com/ 
      - **Python**: https://www.python.org/; https://realpython.com/installing-python/ 

2. **Using Github Codespaces**: on this repository, click on the green button with the `Code` name on it. Select CodeSpaces, and click the + button. This will create a virtual environment in which you can run the Jupyter notebook. CodeSpaces will open a virtual VS Code window in your browser and when trying to run the cells within the notebook, it will automatically prompt you with messages about the suggested and necessary extensions to install.
